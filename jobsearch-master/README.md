# Why am I applying for this job?
Always striving for efficiency leaves a person with 
many opportunities for optimization. I wanted a way 
to separate jobs seeking a "learning machinist" from 
a person who is using "machine learning" or the expert
in Excel analytics from the billion row data miner. 
The following python code is an attempt to separate 
the wheat from the chaff.

The job data came from indeed, they have a nice 
API that provides json results. It's only a few lines
of code to get this into a document database.

Please see the <a href="jobsearch.ipynb">ipython notebook</a> for this project.
